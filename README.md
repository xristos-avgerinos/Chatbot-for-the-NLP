# Chatbot for the NLP
A group project that was developed as a university assignment for the subject "Natural Language Processing".

It is about a simple Chatbot sample task on "Chat with a Witcher".
The work aims to show how in a simple way we create a chatbot that you use for a non-established purpose such as the representation of a virtual character in a Roleplaying environment. Additionally it presents a way for many users to have access
on it via Discord.

**Group members involved in this project:**<br>
Athanasios Bitakis, Dimitrios Panagiotopoulos, Avgerinos Christos.
